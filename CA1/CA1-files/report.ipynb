    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "● Finds the shortest path (optimal solution).  \n",

    "**Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "● Consumes a lot of memory because it stores all possible states at each level.  \n",
    "● Its efficiency decreases in large state spaces.\n",

    "### **DFS Algorithm:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "● Uses less memory compared to BFS.  \n",
    "● Can be more efficient in certain problems like puzzles or games with a smaller search space.  \n",
    "● Simple to implement, often using recursion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "● Does not guarantee the shortest path.  \n",
    "● May get stuck in infinite loops in case of cycles, unless the graph is properly managed.  \n",
    "● Can be inefficient in large search spaces as it explores one branch completely before moving to others.\n",

    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "● Combines the benefits of both DFS and BFS.  \n",

    "● Suitable for problems with large state spaces where memory usage is a concern.  \n",

    "● Guarantees the optimal solution if the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates the true cost).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**  \n",
    "● Can be memory-intensive, as it needs to store all nodes in the open and closed lists.  \n",

    "● May not perform well on very large or complex graphs with a poor heuristic.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "● Finds the shortest path like A*, but with a weight factor that allows faster solutions in certain cases.  \n",
    "● Can be more efficient than regular A* when an approximate solution is acceptable.  \n",
    "● Suitable for problems where finding an optimal solution quickly is more important than finding the exact optimal path.  \n",
