# Artificial Intelligence Course - Spring 2025

This repository contains the programming assignments (Computer Assignments - CAs) for the Artificial Intelligence course offered in Spring 2025.

## Assignments

### CA1 – Search Algorithms
Implement solutions to a problem using uninformed (e.g., BFS, DFS, UCS) and informed (e.g., A*, Greedy) search algorithms.

### CA2 – Genetic Algorithm and Adversarial Search
- Part 1: Implement a Genetic Algorithm to solve a specified optimization problem.
- Part 2: Develop an agent for the Pentago game using the Minimax algorithm.

### CA3 – Machine Learning
Apply supervised learning techniques such as decision trees, k-NN, or SVM on a real-world dataset and evaluate their performance.

### CA4 – Neural Networks
Design and train a neural network for classification or regression tasks, focusing on the implementation of feedforward and backpropagation algorithms.

### CA5 – Clustering
Explore unsupervised learning methods by applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, or Hierarchical Clustering
